        <h1>Hi, I’m Kyler.</h1>
        <p>
          I’m a mechanical engineering student at Boston University with a concentration in aerospace engineering. My interests consist of drone building, robotics, custom electronics, 
          and unique aerodynamic design. I especially like building UAVs, due to the breadth of exposure you get to various different engineering fields, in avionics design, streamlined aerodynamics, 
          and control systems. 
        </p>

        <h2>Highlights</h2>
        <div class="card">
          <strong>RC UAV Project</strong>
          <div class="small">I wanted to have a fully customized drone that could be easily modified with different sensors/devices on digital and analog lines, so I designed, built, wired, and coded a 
          flyable remote-controlled UAV with the computer being an ESP32 microcontroller. </div>

          <strong>Long Distance Radio Head-Tracking Gimbal</strong>
          <div class="small">This project uses a gyroscope and radio to operate a 2-axis gimbal FPV camera which allows for any direction
            you are facing to be translated into a specific direction the camera is facing. This allows you to essential operate a camera wirelessly
            in real time and follows your head movements.</div>
