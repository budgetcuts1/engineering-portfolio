          <strong>RC UAV with observation capabilities</strong>
          <p class="small">This was a smaller scale project which involved 3D-printing a gear system on the rear motor of an RC aircraft. The purpose of
          having a thrust vectoring system is allowing for much greater maneuverability and eventually the ability to create flight control systems
          where the plane can stabilize itself with a thrust-vectoring system.  It operates by having a servo, whose gear is integrated with the first 
          main gear, is attached to a compound gear which leads into the engine-mounted gear.
          The rear motor is designed to have a vector angle of around 20 degrees in yaw, which means that from the horizontal axis straight down the aircraft,
          the motor is designed to move left or right 10 degrees in either direction. This was done by doing a 9:1 gear reduction to reduce 180 degrees down
          to 20 degrees. <br><br> The motor ideally was designed to turn 20 degrees but after testing, it was only rotating 5-10 degrees. This was apparently
          due to the limits of the ELRS open source radio-control software, which only allows PWM inputs of 1000-2000us when the servo I was using had a range
          of 500-2500us. I simply changed the gear ratio to be closer to 4:1 because the range was around half of originally designed.

            <br> Note: Another gear was located between these two gears to complete the mount however this photo was taken before I had mounted the 
            additional gear, and also before more recent modifications I have made due to problems in the servo range.
