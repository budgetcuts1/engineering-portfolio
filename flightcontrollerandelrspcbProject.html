          <strong>PCB Flight Controller and ELRS reciever</strong>
          <p class="small">This flight controller was designed to be able to handle a large variety of PWM ports and have a wide range of capabilities for different ports and sensors.
          The microcontroller used is a STM32H743, and the board includes a port for an ELRS reciever, GPS, 14 PWM, analog sensors and voltage measurement, and a SPI interface port.
          The board is designed mainly for fixed-wing aircraft, and specifically a VTOL aircraft which is why there are so many PWM pins, but the board can be used with quadcopters too.
          I also included a USB port on the flight controller to be able to load software onto the microcontroller such as Ardupilot. 
          I tried to keep the board size relatively small, and size comes in around a 70mmx70mm square.<br><br>The ELRS reciever is a module designed
          to be used with any sort of radio-controlled drone or car. It has 7 PWM outputs built into the board or can be
          or can be simply used as TX and RX through two UART pins located on the board. The board contains two pins for a large external capacitor (470-1000uF) and ADC voltage measurement
          with data ELRS is able to send back to the transmitter.</p>
