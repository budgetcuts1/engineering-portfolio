          <strong>RC UAV with observation capabilities</strong>
          <p class="small">This project consisted of various different aspects which I had to combine into one working system. The plane included custom coded controls, operated by
          flight simulator joystick, connected by ESP32 microcontrollers, and had Rylr998 radio modules to maintain communication. It was built in SolidWorks CAD initially to 
          get a preliminary design and create the blueprints for the foamboard structure of the wing. I used Solidworks Flow Simulation to optimize the chord length of the aircraft and
          also selected the SD7037 airfoil as it has very good performance at lower Reynolds numbers, since the drone typically operates at a Reynolds number lower than 1 million.
          The aircraft uses a 1000kv brushless motor with a 10x4 propeller which gives adequate thrust, and servos for the control surfaces and camera module. 
          <br><br>The controls were mapped with Python by first taking the 
          joystick's data and sending it using serial communication through a USB port. This data onboard one ESP32 was sent through the transmitter radio to a reciever, which was 
          connected to the aircraft's ESP32. Due to the radio modules being long range but with a low data rate, the byte size had to be optimized in C++ as low as possible to
          increase the data rate between the transmitter and reciever. Most of the individual data values were packed to 1 byte, which gives a range of 255 and contains the 
          joystick's integer range of 0 to 180. Apart from the main control surfaces on the aircraft, there is a 2-axis gimbal mounted on the underside of the UAV which allows 
          for rotation in a semi-sphere range underneath the aircraft and can be either mounted with a small video camera or a live FPV camera.</p>
