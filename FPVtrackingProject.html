          <strong>FPV Orientation Tracking with Radio</strong>
          <p class="small">This project involves a transmitter and reciever, which is designed to record the direction you are facing and then
            convert that into a signal that is sent to two servos by radio and points a camera in the same direction. This
            involves using two ESP32 microcontrollers, two RYLR998 radio modules, and a Pololu MINIMU-9 gyroscope/accelerometer/magnetometer. 
            The device works by calculating the angles for pitch and yaw from raw IMU measurements and then sending that over the RYLR998 radio from
            the transmitter to the reciever to actuate the reciever side's servos.<br><br>My original code at trying to take the angle from the raw
            measurements was somewhat succesful but experienced a lot of drift which made it unreliable for use longer than a minute. This was
            inadequate for the system so instead I opted to use an open source repository called MINIMU9 AHRS made by Pololu, the company where the 
            MINIMU-9 sensor is from. This system has much more accurate directional tracking and filtering which was needed to get a solid angle calculation. I then
            added on callibration adjustments and my radio code to send the data from the transmitter to the reciever.
